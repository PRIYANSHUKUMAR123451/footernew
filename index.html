        <p class="m">At Flitchcoin, we want to make sure our customers are aware of the risks associated with investing in digital assets, including price volatility. Transacting in digital assets could result in significant losses and may not be suitable for all consumers. The digital asset markets and exchanges we operate on are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections as other forms of financial products and are subject to an evolving regulatory environment. Digital assets do not typically have legal tender status and are not covered by deposit protection insurance. Past performance of a digital asset is not a guide to future performance and should not be relied upon as a reliable indicator of future results or performance.
            <br><br><br>
            Please be aware that investing in digital assets carries a number of risks and should be carefully considered. For more information on the risks associated with investing in digital assets, please see our Legal and Privacy page.
